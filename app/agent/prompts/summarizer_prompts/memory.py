================================================
Instruction for compressing mem0 long-term memory results.

Used by ``app/agent/memory.py`` to summarize the (potentially huge)
list of mem0 search results into a compact, factual summary of user
preferences and store knowledge before it enters the main LLM context.

    "Extract ONLY durable, reusable facts and categorize them strictly into three distinct memory levels:\n\n"
    "1. USER PREFERENCES ('user_preferences'):\n"
    "   - Communication style (e.g. prefers detailed point-wise reports, bullet points, concise summaries, tables).\n"
    "   - Language/tone preferences (e.g. prefers Hindi, English, Hinglish, formal tone).\n"
    "   - Long-term strategic business goals stated by user (e.g. 'targeting 15% margin growth in Q3').\n"
    "   - EXCLUDE: One-off questions, specific current stock queries, temporary status requests, greetings, code/programming queries.\n\n"
    "2. STORE KNOWLEDGE ('store_knowledge'):\n"
    "   - Store-specific operational rules & facts (e.g. 'Supplier Amul delivers on Tuesdays at 8 AM', 'Store is closed on Sundays').\n"
    "   - Recurring local sales trends, peak footfall hours, local store policies.\n"
    "   - Explicit inventory decisions made for this store (e.g. 'Minimum safety stock for Milk set to 20 units').\n"
    "   - EXCLUDE: Ephemeral tool responses, temporary stock levels ('Laptop stock is 2'), raw chat turns, generic advice.\n\n"
    "3. MULTI-STORE KNOWLEDGE ('multi_store_knowledge'):\n"
    "   - Cross-store inventory transfer rules (e.g. 'Rebalance excess stock from Main Warehouse to Store B when stock > 100').\n"
    "   - Multi-location volume discounts or chain-wide supplier agreements.\n"
    "   - Enterprise multi-store business strategies.\n"
    "   - EXCLUDE: Single-store facts, individual store stock counts.\n\n"
    "CRITICAL RULES:\n"
    "- If a category has NO new durable facts in this exchange, return an empty array [] for that category.\n"
    "- Do NOT extract raw Q&A logs, greetings ('hi', 'hello'), out-of-scope requests (e.g. Java code), or temporary numerical stock counts.\n"
    "- Return ONLY a valid JSON object matching this exact schema:\n"
    "{\n"

    '  "store_knowledge": ["concise fact 1", ...],\n'

MEMORY_RECONCILIATION_INSTRUCTION = (

    "Compare the NEW CANDIDATE FACT against existing stored memories.\n"
    "Maintain strict consistency without duplication, contradiction, or stale facts.\n\n"
    "Determine appropriate action for each item:\n"
    "- UPDATE: If the new fact updates or refines an existing memory (output consolidated text).\n"
